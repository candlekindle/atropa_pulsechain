[15:18:10] <mariarahel> I think I need to build in the basic buffers before Fi
[15:18:43] <mariarahel> I don't know what to call them though
[15:19:32] <mariarahel> I am using counters for a few basic functions right now
[15:19:46] <mariarahel> those will all be replaced by what the buffers are
[15:22:46] <mariarahel> probably going to use length of the buffer instead of counters unless there's a more sure-fire way
[15:23:25] <mariarahel> if the buffer is executed upon regardless of length and defines itself somehow through its construction that might be best
[15:23:54] <mariarahel> so the loop just executes the buffer instead of any state machine
[15:24:18] <mariarahel> a buffer but a vm
[15:24:59] <mariarahel> it's bad to call it a vm because there will absolutely not be code
[15:25:27] <mariarahel> i have to think more about it
[15:26:32] <mariarahel> the buffers always start with Mu(Barn, Psi, Ring);
[15:26:39] <mariarahel> Where Psi Is Anything
[15:27:23] <mariarahel> And Ring Is = 200560490131 Specifically Where 200560490131 != 200560490131
